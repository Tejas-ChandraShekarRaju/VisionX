Cost Functions - 
The goal of using a cost function is typically to adjust the inputs (parameters, configurations) to minimize the output (cost/error) for 
better model performance or accurate representation of data. This doesnâ€™t mean manually adjusting the input parameters. Has to be done algorithmically. 


Something about Hierarchical Clustering
In other words, it's questioning whether, no matter how many clusters you want to divide your data into, 
there's a method within hierarchical clustering that comes close to the best possible way of dividing them based on some fair measure of quality.
