##Cost Functions - 
The goal of using a cost function is typically to adjust the inputs (parameters, configurations) to minimize the output (cost/error) for 
better model performance or accurate representation of data. This doesnâ€™t mean manually adjusting the input parameters. Has to be done algorithmically. 
This means that the 'cost' of how well a dataset is clustered is measured by how spread out the farthest points are within the clusters. 
If clusters have smaller radii, it indicates that the points are closer to their respective centers,making the clustering more compact and potentially better 
in terms of this cost function.


##Something about Hierarchical Clustering
In other words, it's questioning whether, no matter how many clusters you want to divide your data into, 
there's a method within hierarchical clustering that comes close to the best possible way of dividing them based on some fair measure of quality.

##Largest Radius of a Cluster
Imagine you've divided your data into clusters. Each cluster has its own center, and the radius of a cluster is the distance from that center to the farthest point within 
that cluster. So, the largest radius among all these clusters gives you the cost of that specific clustering.
